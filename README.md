# Tools list

Hello! I'm [Gleb Shalimov](https://khlebobul.github.io/), a student, programmer, and enthusiast of innovative tools.

In 2021, I stumbled upon Product Hunt and began regularly suggesting different tools to my friends. This led me to create a small [channel](https://t.me/ph_daily) on Telegram, where I shared my discoveries. 

As the number of posts grew, I wanted to compile a list of the tools that have piqued my interest the most and that I use regularly, in a publicly accessible format.

If your favorite tool isn't on the list, feel free to fork this repository and submit a PR. I'll make sure to check it out.
